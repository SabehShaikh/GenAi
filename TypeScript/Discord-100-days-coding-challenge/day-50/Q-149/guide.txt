Start of Execution:
When your JavaScript program starts running, it initializes the main thread and starts executing code line by line.

The main thread includes the call stack, which keeps track of the currently executing function or code block.


Synchronous Code Execution:
Synchronous code, like your console.log("Start") and console.log("End"), is executed sequentially in the order it appears in your code.

These statements are pushed onto the call stack and executed one after the other.


Asynchronous Operation Encountered (setTimeout):

When the JavaScript engine encounters an asynchronous operation, such as setTimeout, it delegates the handling of that operation to the browser's or Node.js's runtime environment.
In the case of setTimeout, the callback function is scheduled to run after a minimum delay, even if that delay is 0 milliseconds.

Task Queue and Event Loop:

After the specified delay, the callback function of setTimeout is not immediately executed. Instead, it is placed in the task queue.
The task queue holds callback functions and events that are ready to be executed.
The event loop is a mechanism that continuously checks if the call stack is empty and if there are tasks in the task queue.

Empty Call Stack Check:

After executing "End", the call stack becomes empty because there are no more synchronous tasks to execute.
The event loop then checks if the call stack is empty and if there are tasks in the task queue.

Task Execution from Task Queue:

Since there is a task (the setTimeout callback) in the task queue and the call stack is empty, the event loop takes the callback function from the task queue.
The callback function is pushed onto the call stack for execution.

Execution of setTimeout Callback:

The console.log("Inside setTimeout callback") statement inside the callback function is executed, logging "Inside setTimeout callback" to the console.
Completion and Cleanup:

After executing the callback, the call stack becomes empty again.
The event loop continues this process, checking for tasks in the task queue and executing them when the call stack is empty.
